## Introduction

The results of the M5 dataset could be reproduced directly, while the results of the M4 dataset is not. The reason is that the latter takes a long time (several days) to run without parrellel computation. Unforetunately, the parrellel computation mysterious fails on one of our computers. Thus, to avoid this issue, we only include a demo of the M4 dataset using all 17 teams and 119 variables. The result still shows that P:Linear dominates other benchmarks.
